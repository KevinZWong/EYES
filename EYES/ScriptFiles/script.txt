 Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Goldilocks who wandered into the forest and stumbled upon a cottage
The cottage belonged to three bears, a Papa Bear, a Mama Bear, and a Baby Bear
Finding the bears away, Goldilocks entered the cottage and explored
She tried their porridge Papa Bear's was too hot, Mama Bear's was too cold, but Baby Bear's was just right, so she ate it all
Then she tried the chairs
Papa Bear's was too hard, Mama Bear's was too soft, but Baby Bear's was just right, though it broke under her weight
Finally, feeling tired, Goldilocks tried their beds
Papa Bear's was too firm, Mama Bear's was too soft, but Baby Bear's was just right
And then she fell asleep
When the bears returned and found her, Goldilocks woke up, got scared, ran away, and back to her home, never to return to the forest again
